# CTF_UNICON2020
UNICON 2020 CTF write-up hosted on the netwars  platform




# UNICON >>> KnowYourPayloads.counterhack.com CTF 
We've detected malicious activity on an endpoint after a recruiter downloaded a 
resume.doc which executed some sort of malware. We were able to take that 
endpoint offline before it could do any major damage (we think), but we'd like you 
to investigate what exactly the executable does. This CT F will be 3 levels and 
require you to run 3 different pieces of synthetic malware and analyze what it 
does. Level 1 and 2 are question/answer format while level 3 asks you to go way 
deeper. 

## THANKS AGIAN SCYTHE-SANS 
## CTF PREGAME 

â€¢ Start - PowerShell - right click- Run as Administrator
>Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true

After downloading the Level 1 payload and unzipping it we can alt+space using powertoys and search cmd you can run as root but you dont have to for this one. Navigate to the path/to/file and execute certutil commands to check hashes. There are other ways to get hashes as well using powershell and cmd like Get-FileHash. Also you can use File Checksum Integrity Util it's a freebie and is pretty easy to install and use.
